## Hopfield network with image recognition and correction

This is a project as part of my computer science course. I was assigned to create a Hopfield network with text pattern inputs.

I decided to enhance that and implemenet image recognition and correction. 


### How to use

The program requires a text file listing the pathway ways to the images to be trained and the corrupted images to be fixed.

The text files should be laid out like the following:

```
example_images/100_stored_1.png
example_images/100_stored_2.png
example_images/100_stored_3.png
example_images/100_stored_4.png
```

```
example_images/100_corrupt_1.png
example_images/100_corrupt_2.png
example_images/100_corrupt_3.png
example_images/100_corrupt_4.png
```

There are example images and input files, with both 16x16 images and 100x100 images. 

The program is run on commandline with the following syntax:  
```
java Main "pathway to the training images" "pathway to the corrupt images"
```
